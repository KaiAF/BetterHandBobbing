### Better Hand Bobbing
What this mod does is separates the screen shake and the hand bobbing in the view bobbing setting. So if you want to play the game without the screen shaking but with the hand shaking, you can!

**For versions 1.19.4 and below, this mod will not work with OptiFine. I do plan to eventually back-port, just not now.**
