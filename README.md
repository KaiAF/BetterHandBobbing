### Better Hand Bobbing
What this mod does is separates the screen shake and the hand bobbing in the view bobbing setting. So if you want to play the game without the screen shaking but with the hand shaking, you can!

This feature is unfortunately incompatible with OptiFine (**entirely**) and IrisShaders **while** having shaders enabled. It's due to how they handle the hand rendering while shaders are enabled.

I've tested with more than a few mods, it seems to work fine.
